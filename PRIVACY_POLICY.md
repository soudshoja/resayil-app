## Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

Resayil uses Google Firebase Cloud Messaging to deliver push notifications for incoming messages and group updates. In this process:
- Your device token is securely stored on our servers
- Firebase may collect basic device identifiers and app usage information
- Push notifications contain only the message summary, not sensitive content
- You can disable notifications at any time through your device settings
- Firebase's privacy practices are governed by Google's Privacy Policy

## Data Storage and Security

### Secure Storage
- API credentials and authentication tokens are stored using industry-standard encrypted secure storage (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore)
- Sensitive authentication data is never stored in plain text
- All API communication uses HTTPS with TLS encryption

### Message Transmission
- All messages are transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections
- We recommend using network connections you trust
- The App supports secure communication protocols

### Local Database
- Messages are cached locally on your device using SQLite
- This local cache is encrypted on modern iOS and Android versions
- Only you have access to your locally stored messages

## Data Sharing

We do **NOT**:
- Sell your personal information to third parties
- Share your messages with advertisers or marketing companies
- Use tracking/analytics tools (Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics for user tracking)
- Share your contacts with any external service

We **MAY** share data in these limited cases:
- With Firebase services (for push notification infrastructure only)
- With hosting/cloud infrastructure providers necessary to operate the service
- When required by law or legal process
- To protect against fraud or security threats

## Data Retention

- **API Tokens:** Retained while your account is active
- **Device Tokens (FCM):** Retained for push notification delivery; removed when you delete your account or disable notifications

You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time by contacting our support team.
